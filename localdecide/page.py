"""The browser-agent contract: an observation becomes a numbered table the model may choose from.

The whole idea in one sentence: **never let the model name a target; let it pick the
index of a target you observed.** The model sees labels; your code owns the mapping
from index back to the real DOM node, so model output can never become a selector,
a coordinate, or executable code.

    observation ──► ElementTable ──► questions ──► Decider ──► index ──► your executor

The element table is deliberately dumb: a list of things a human could click, type
into, or select, each with its role, label and current value. Two implementations can
feed it - a CDP/Playwright snapshot, or the accessibility tree - and the model never
learns the difference.
