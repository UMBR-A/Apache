"""The loop: observe, decide once, act, repeat - with the guardrails that keep it honest.

Two rules make a small decision model safe to run unattended against a real browser:

1. **The model picks an index, your code does everything else.** The decision names
   `operation` and a target index; the executor resolves that index to its own node
   handle. Model output never becomes a selector, a coordinate, or executable code.
2. **The loop, not the model, tracks history.** Repeated actions, unchanged pages and
   step budgets are detected in code, so a model that loops is stopped by the harness
   rather than trusted to notice.

The loop is driver-agnostic on purpose: pass any object with
`observe() -> observation` and `execute(operation, element, text) -> result`.
`localdecide.drivers` ships a Playwright driver; a CDP driver is about 40 lines.
