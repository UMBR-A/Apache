"""The real cause: state shape decides, not instruction wording.

Same options, same goal, opposite answers:
  - fixture state (real page text) -> CLICK on the submit button, p=0.976
  - synthetic state (short text)   -> TYPE_TEXT into the field,  p=0.946

The difference is what the *state* says about where the flow already is. The fixture page
renders "Cart: 0 item(s) · Step 1", and its field carries a `current_value` of "" - read by
the model as "this step may already be under way". This script isolates the variable.
