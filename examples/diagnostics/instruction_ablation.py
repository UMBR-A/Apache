"""Experiment: which instruction shape makes the checkpoint type before it submits?

The observed failure: on a search form, the goal "Search products for 'kettle'" produced
`CLICK` on the Search button (p=0.976) instead of `TYPE_TEXT` into the empty field. The
rules text IS reaching the model (243 tokens, inside the 432-token budget), so the
question is whether the *shape* of the instruction matches what the checkpoint was
fine-tuned on. This runs the same page and goal through several instruction variants and
prints what each one chooses.
