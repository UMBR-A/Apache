"""Is the answer a decision, or a position bias? Measure it before tuning anything.

Two things to separate:

1. **Order sensitivity** - does the same option set, shuffled, produce different answers?
   If yes, the model reads position as well as content, and multi-permutation voting can
   cancel that noise out.
2. **Whether voting actually helps** - averaging over permutations costs N forward passes,
   so it has to buy accuracy, not just feel safer.

Ground truth here is "does any permutation get the intended element right", and the metric
we care about is top-1 across permutations vs top-1 of a single ordering.
