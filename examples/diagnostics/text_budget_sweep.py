"""Page text is a first-class knob. Find the setting that keeps decisions honest.

Finding this measures: with the full fixture text visible, the model answers CLICK on a
submit button while the search field is empty; with no page text it answers TYPE_TEXT. The
text length steers the decision more than any instruction wording does.

Two variables are swept here because they interact:
  * `text_chars`  - how much page prose the model sees
  * "field visible" - whether a `type_text_target` question was offered at all

The second one matters because `table_to_questions` only offers an operation when the page
has a control for it. A state built from a full-page table but questions built from a
scoped table is an inconsistent pair, and the earlier version of this script made exactly
that mistake - which is why its numbers disagreed with the decision-level experiments.
